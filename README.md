# Ecma TC39 JavaScript Decimal proposal

The TC39 Decimal proposal is an investigation into adding a
built-in data type in JavaScript to represent base-10
decimal numbers.

This whole proposal is a big open question, and we’d welcome your participation in discussing the design space in the issues linked above. **We are seeking input for your needs around JavaScript decimal in [this survey](https://forms.gle/A2YaTr3Tn1o3D7hdA).**

**Champions**:

+ Jesse Alama (Igalia)
+ Andrew Paprocki (Bloomberg)

**Stage**: Stage 1 of [the TC39 process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/).

## Use cases and goals

Accurate storage and processing of base-10 decimal numbers is a frequent need in JavaScript. Currently, developers sometimes represent these using libraries for this purpose, or sometimes use Strings. Sadly, JavaScript Numbers are also sometimes used, leading to real, end-user-visible rounding
errors.

What’s the issue? Why aren’t JS Numbers good enough? In what sense are they not “exact”?

As currently defined in JavaScript, Numbers 64-bit binary floating-point numbers, and the conversion from most decimal values to binary floats rarely is an exact match. For instance: 0.5 works, but 0.1 does not (the "0.1" 64-bit floating point number is actually 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625). Same for 0.2, 0.3, … Statistically, most human-authored decimal numbers cannot be exactly represented as a binary float.

The goal of the Decimal proposal is to add a decimal type to the JavaScript standard library, in a way that provides such good ergonomics, functionality, and performance that people feel comfortable using it when it’s appropriate. Being built-in to JavaScript means that we will get optimizable, well-maintained implementations that don’t require transmitting, storing, or parsing and jit-optimizing every time additional JavaScript code.

Due to complicated design questions (see below), as well as possible interaction with other proposals (especially operator overloading), the champions do not expect Decimal to move as quickly through TC39’s process as BigInt did.

### Primary use case: Representing human-readable decimal values such as money

Many currencies tend to be expressed with decimal quantities. Although it’s possible to represent money as integer “cents”, this approach runs into a couple of issues:

+ There’s a persistent mismatch between the way humans think about money and the way it’s manipulated in the program, causing mental overhead for the programmer aware of the issue.
  + Some programmers may not even be aware of this mismatch. This opens the door to rounding errors whose source is unknown. If calculations start to get more involved, the chance of error increases.
+ Different currencies use different numbers of decimal positions which is easy to get confused; the hack of working with integers may not work when working with multiple currencies. For instance, it’s not correct to assume that all currencies have two decimal places, or that the only exception is JPY (Japanese yen); making such assumptions will make it hard to internationalize code to new countries. For this reason, it’s ideal if the number of decimal places is part of the data type.
+ In various contexts (e.g., presenting a quantity to the end user), the fractionality needs to be brought back in somehow. For example, `Intl.NumberFormat` only knows how to format Numbers, and can’t deal with an integer-and-exponent pair.
+ Sometimes, fractional cents need to be represented too (e.g., as precise prices that occur, for instance, in stock trading or currency conversion).

#### Sample code

##### Add up the items of a bill, then add sales tax

```js
function calculateBill(items, tax) {
  let total = new Decimal("0");
  for (let {price, count} of items) {
    total = total.add(price.times(new Decimal(count)));
  }
  return total.multiply(new Decimal(tax).add(1));
}

let items = [{price: "1.25", count: 5}, {price: "5.00", count: 1}];
let tax = "0.0735";
console.log(calculateBill(items, tax).toFixed(2));
```

##### Amortization schedule for a loan

```js
const principal = new Decimal("500000");
const annualInterestRate = new Decimal("0.05");
const paymentsPerYear = new Decimal("12");
const monthlyInterestRate = annualInterestRate.divide(paymentsPerYear);
const years = new Decimal("30");
const one = new Decimal("1");
const paymentCount = paymentsPerYear.times(years);
const monthlyPaymentAmount = principal.times(monthlyInterestRate)
    .divide(one.minus(monthlyInterestRate).pow(paymentCount).minus(one))
    .times(one.add(monthlyInterestRate));
```

##### Stepping up/down a value by a small amount

```js
function stepUp(d, n, x) {
  let increment = new Decimal("10").pow(x);
  return d.add(n.times(increment));
}

let starting = new Decimal("1.23");
let stepped = stepUp(starting, new Decimal("3"), new Decimal("-4"));
console.log(stepped.toFixed(4)); // 1.2305
```

#### Why use JavaScript for this case?

Historically, JavaScript may not have been considered a language where exact decimal numbers are even representable, to say nothing of doing (exact) calculations. In some application architectures, JS only deals with a string representing a human-readable decimal quantity, and never do calculations or conversions. However, several trends push towards JS’s deeper involvement in with decimal quantities:

+ **More complicated frontend architectures**: Rounding, localization or other presentational aspects may be performed on the frontend for better interactive performance.
+ **Serverless**: Many Serverless systems use JavaScript as a programming language in order to better leverage the knowledge of frontend engineers.
+ **Server-side programming in JavaScript**: Systems like Node.js and Deno have grown in popularity to do more traditional server-side programming in JavaScript.

In all of these environments, the lack of decimal number support means that various workarounds have to be used (assuming, again, that the programmers are aware of the mismatch between JS’s built-in binary floating-point numbers and proper decimal numbers):

+ An external library could be used instead (introducing issues about choosing the library, coordinating on its use). Several options are available:
+ Calculations could be in terms of “cents” (fallible as explained above)
+ In some cases, developers end up using Number instead, believing it to be mostly safe, but in practice causing bugs, even if tries take care of any issues involving rounding or non-exact conversions from decimals to binary floats

In other words, with JS increasingly being used in contexts and scenarios where it traditionally did not appear, the need for being able to natively handle basic data, such as decimal numbers, that other systems already natively handle is increasing.

#### Goals implied by the main use cases

This use case implies the following goals:

+ Avoid unintentional rounding that causes user-visible errors
+ Basic mathematical functions such as `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`
+ Sufficient precision for typical money and other human-readable quantities, including cryptocurrency (where many decimal digits are routinely needed)
+ Conversion to a string in a locale-sensitive manner
+ Sufficient ergonomics to enable correct usage
+ Be implementable with adequate performance/memory usage for applications
+ (Please file an issue to mention more requirements)

### Secondary use case: Data exchange

In both frontend and backend settings, JavaScript is used to communicate with external systems, such as databases and foreign function interfaces to other programming languages. Many external systems already natively support decimal numbers. In such a setting, JavaScript is then the lower common denominator. With decimals in JavaScript, one has the confident that the numeric data one consumes and produces is handled exactly.

#### Why use JavaScript for this case?

JavaScript is frequently used as a language to glue other systems together, whether in client, server or embedded applications. Its ease of programming and embedding, and ubiquity, lend itself to this sort of use case. Programmers often don’t have the option to choose another language. When decimals appear in these contexts, it adds more burden on the embedder to develop an application-specific way to handle things; such specificity makes things less composable.

#### Goals implied by the use case

This use case implies the following goals:

+ Basic mathematical functions such as `+`, `-`, `*` should be available
+ Sufficient precision for these applications (unclear how high--would require more analysis of applications)
+ Be implementable with adequate performance/memory usage for applications
+ -0, NaN, infinities may be useful here, rather than exceptions, to continue work in exceptional conditions
+ (Please file an issue to mention more requirements)

Interaction with other systems brings the following requirements:

+ Ability to round-trip decimal quantities from other systems
+ Serialization and deserialization in standard decimal formats, e.g., IEEE 754’s multiple formats
+ Precision sufficient for the applications on the other side

#### Sample code

##### Configure a database adaptor to use JS-native decimals

The following is fictional, but illustrates the idea. Notice the `sql_decimal` configuration option and how the values returned from the DB are handled in JS as Decimal values, rather than as strings or as JS `Number`s:

```js
const { Client } = require('pg');

const client = new Client({
  user: 'username',
  sql_decimal: 'decimal128', // or 'string', 'number'
  // ...more options      
});

const boost = new Decimal("1.05");

client.query('SELECT prices FROM data_with_numbers', (err, res) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(res.rows.map(row => row.prices.times(boost)));
  client.end();
});
```

### Tertiary use case: Numerical calculations on more precise floats

If it works out reasonably to provide for it within the same proposal, it would also be nice to provide support for higher-precision applications of floating point numbers.

If Decimal is arbitrary-precision or supports greater precision than Number, it may also be used for applications which need very large floating point numbers, such as astronomical calculations, physics, or even certain games. In some sense, larger or arbitrary-precision binary floats (as supported by [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/), or IEEE 754 128-bit/256-bit binary floats) may be more efficient, but Decimal may also be suitable. In particular, if the need is for human-consumable, and reproducible, calculations, Decimal may offer some advantages compared to binary floats.

### Language design goals

In addition to the goals which come directly from use cases mentioned above,

+ Well-defined semantics, with the same result regardless of which implementation and context a piece of code is run in
+ Build a consistent story for numerics in JavaScript together with Numbers, BigInt, operator overloading, and
  potential future built-in numeric types
+ No global mutable state involved in operator semantics; dynamically scoped state also discouraged
+ Ability to be implemented across all JavaScript environment (e.g., embedded, server, browser)

### Interactions with other parts of the web platform

If Decimal becomes a part of standard JavaScript, it may be used in some built-in APIs in host environments:

+ For the Web platform:
  ([#4](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/4))
  + HTML serialization would support Decimal, just as it supports BigInt, so Decimal could be used in `postMessage`, `IndexedDB`, etc.
+ For WebAssembly, if WebAssembly adds IEEE 64-bit and/or 128-bit decimal scalar types some day, then the WebAssembly/JS API could introduce conversions along the boundary, analogous to [WebAssembly BigInt/i64 integration](https://github.com/WebAssembly/JS-BigInt-integration)

More host API interactions are discussed in [#5](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/5).

## Early draft syntax and semantics

With this proposal at Stage 1, details aren’t nailed down. However, for concreteness, some initial possible details are provided below. You’re encouraged to join the discussion by commenting on the issues linked below or [filing your
own](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/new).

We are leaning toward using the **Decimal128** data model for JavaScript decimals. Decimal128 is not a new standard; it was added to the IEEE 754 standard in 2008. It represents the culmination of decades of research, both theoretical and practical, on decimal floating-point numbers. Values in the Decimal128 universe take up 128 bits. In this representation, up to 34 significant digits (that is, decimal digits) can be stored, with an exponent (power of ten) of +/- 6143.

### Known alternatives

#### BigDecimal

The data model here consists of unlimited size decimals, represented exactly as mathematical values.

From the champion group’s perspective, both BigDecimal and Decimal128 are both coherent, valid proposals that would meet the needs of the primary use case. Just looking at the diversity of semantics in other programming languages, and the lack of practical issues that programmers run into, shows us that there are many workable answers here.

Operators always calculate their exact answer. In particular, if two BigDecimals are multiplied, the precision of the result may be up to the *sum* of the operands. For this reason, `BigDecimal.pow` takes a mandatory options object, to ensure that the result does not go out of control in precision.

One can conceive of an arbitrary-precision version of decimals, and we have explored that route; historical information is available at [bigdecimal-reference.md](./bigdecimal-reference.md).

One difficulty with BigDecimal is that division is not available as a two-argument function because a rounding parameter is, in general, required. A `BigDecimal.div` function would be needed, where some options would be mandatory. See [#13](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/13) for further discussion of division in BigDecimal.

Further discussion of the tradeoffs between BigDecimal and Decimal128 can be found in [#8](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/8).

#### Fixed-precision decimals

Imagine that every decimal number has, say, ten digits after the decimal point. Anything requiring, say, eleven digits after the decimal point would be unrepresentable. This is the world of fixed-precision decimals. The number ten is just an example; some research would be required to find out what a good number would be. One could even imagine that the precision of such numbers could be parameterized.

#### Rationals

Rational numbers, AKA fractions, offer an adjacent approach to decimals. From a mathematical point of view, rationals are more expressive than decimals: every decimal is a kind of fraction (a signed integer divided by a power of ten), wheras some rationals, such as 1/3, cannot be (finitely) represented as decimals. So why not rationals?

+ The size of the numerators and denominators, in general, grows exponentially as one carries out operations. Performing just one multiplication or division will in general cause the size of the parts of the rational to be multiplied. Even addition and subtraction cause rapid growth. This means that a heavy cost is paid for the precision offered by rationals.
+ One must be vigilant about normalization of numerators and denominators, which involves repeatedly computing GCDs, dividing numerator and denominator by them, and continuing. The alternative to this is to not normalize rationals, normalize after, say, every five arithmetical operations, and so on. This can be an expensive operation, certainly much more expensive than, say, normalizing "1.20" to "1.2".
+ Various operations, such as exponentiation and logarithm, almost never produce rational numbers given a rational argument, so one would have to specify a certain amount of precision as a second argument to these operations. By contrast, in, say, Decimal128, these operations do not require a second argument.

Fractions would be an interesting thing to pursue in TC39, and are in many ways complementary to Decimal. The use cases for rationals overlap somewhat with the use cases for decimals. Many languages in the Lisp tradition (e.g., [Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/numbers.html)) include rationals as a basic data type, alongside IEEE 754 64-bit binary floating point numbers; Ruby and Python also include fractions in their standard library.

We see rationals as complementary to Decimal because of a mismatch when it comes to two of the core operations on Decimals:

+ Rounding to a certain base-10 precision, with a rounding mode
+ Conversion to a localized, human-readable string

These *could* be defined on rationals, but are a bit of an inherent mismatch since rationals are not base 10.

Rational may still make sense as a separate data type, alongside Decimal. Further discussion of rationals in [#6](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/6).

## Syntax and semantics

With Decimal we do not envision a new literal syntax. One could consider one, such as `123.456_789m` is a Decimal value ([#7](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/7)), but we are choosing not to add new syntax in light of feedback we have received from JS engine implementors as this proposal has been discussed in multiple TC39 plenary meetings.

### Data model

Decimal represents a mathematical, “normalized” ([#26](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/26)) base 10 decimal. IEEE 754 Decimal128 is the underlying set of values (though not all Decimal128 values are available to the JS programmer, since we work, again, only with normalized values, whereas the official IEEE 754 Decimal128 works with unnormalized values). For example, `2`, as a Decimal, is exactly the same value as `2.00m` ([#11](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/11)) If preserving magnitude/precision through trailing zeroes is required, it needs to be represented separately from the Decimal. ([#9](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/9))

### Operator semantics

+ Addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, and remainder are defined.
+ Bitwise operators are not supported, as they don’t logically make sense on the Decimal domain ([#20](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/20))
+ rounding (all five official rounding modes of IEEE 754 are supported)
+ We currently do not foresee Decimal values interacting with other Number values.  Expect TypeErrors when trying to add, say, a Number to a Decimal, like for BigInt and Number. ([#10](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/10)).

Decimal methods for calculation: ([#14](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/14))

The library of numerical functions here is deliberately minimal. It is based around targeting the primary use case, in which fairly straightforward calculations are envisioned. The secondary use case (data exchange) will probably little or no calculation at all. For the tertiary use case of scientific/numerical computations, developers may experiment in JavaScript, developing such libraries, and we may decide to standardize these functions in a follow-on proposal. We currently do not have good insight into the developer needs for this use case, except generically: square roots, exponentiation & logarithms, and trigonometric functions might be needed, but we are not sure if this is a complete list, and which are more important to have than others. In the meantime, one can use the various functions in JavaScript’s `Math` standard library.

### String formatting

+ `toString()` is similar to the behavior on Number, e.g., `new Decimal("123.456").toString()` is `"123.456"`. ([#12](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/12))
+ `toFixed`, `toExponential`, `toPrecision` methods analogous to `Number` methods `Intl.NumberFormat.prototype.format` transparently supports Decimal ([#15](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/15))

## FAQ

### What about rational numbers?

See the discussion above, about data models, where rationals are discussed.

### Will Decimal have good performance?

This depends on implementations. Like BigInt, implementors
may decide whether or not to optimize it, and what scenarios
to optimize for. We believe that, with either alternative,
it is possible to create a high-performance Decimal
implementation. Historically, faced with a similar decision
of BigInt vs Int64, TC39 decided on BigInt; such a decision
might not map perfectly because of differences in the use
cases. Further discussion:
[#27](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal/issues/27)

### Will Decimal have the same behavior across implementations and environments?

One option that’s raised is allowing for greater precision in more capable environments. However, Decimal is all about avoiding unintended rounding. If rounding behavior depended on the environment, the goal would be compromised in those environments. Instead, this proposal attempts to find a single set of semantics that can be applied globally.

### What about decimals elsewhere (the JS ecosystem, other programming languages/systems)?

See [COMPARISON.md](./COMPARISON.md) for details.

### How does this proposal relate to other TC39 proposals like operator overloading?

See [RELATED.md](./RELATED.md) for details.

### Why not have the maximum precision or default rounding mode set by the environment?

Many decimal implementations support a global option to set the maximum precision (e.g., Python, Ruby). In QuickJS, there is a “dynamically scoped” version of this: the `setPrec` method changes the maximum precision while a particular function is running, re-setting it after it returns. Default rounding modes could be set similarly.

Although the dynamic scoping version is a bit more contained, both versions are anti-modular: Code does not exist with independent behavior, but rather behavior that is dependent on the surrounding code that calls it. A reliable library would have to always set the precision around it.

There is further complexity when it comes to JavaScript’s multiple globals/Realms: a Decimal primitive value does not relate to anything global, so it would be inviable to store the state there. It would have to be across all the Decimals in the system. But then, this forms a cross-realm communication channel.

Therefore, this proposal does not contain any options to set the precision from the environment.

### Where can I learn more about decimals in general?

Mike Cowlishaw’s excellent [Decimal FAQ](http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decifaq.html) explains many of the core design principles for decimal data types, which this proposal attempts to follow.

One notable exception is supporting trailing zeroes: Although Mike presents some interesting use cases, the Decimal champion group does not see these as being worth the complexity both for JS developers and implementors. Instead, Decimal values could be lossly represented as rationals, and
are “normalized”.
